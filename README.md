# Dotfiles

I've been convinced. Dotfiles must be treated as first-class citizens. So, here are mine.

## Contents

**Bash**
- Easier color codes (useful for customizing prompt)
- Aliases (git, navigation, rails, misc)
- Functions (java, ruby)
- My prompt (a two-liner with current dir, git branch and status, sad face, and nice colors)

**Vim**
- The bundles I use (via Vundle)
- Key mappings
- Searching
- Indentation
- Visuals
- Misc

**Git**
- Just the basics, nothing fancy

**Rspec**
- Pretty colors
- Cooler and more readable output


## Not included

I don't have a slick way for you to clone down my repo and auto-symlink and immediately have my setup available. Possibly a project for the future.
